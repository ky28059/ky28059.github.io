        Atop a vault of shadows, silent, steep, topaz, pearl keys awake its sleep.
        Crypt sunken 'neath the time's decree, opal, garnet turn the key.
        Cell of frostbound, age-old hex, yields to pearl and onyx's behest.

        Bow of Wizard's study, knowledge bound, diamond, topaz keys unwound.
        Grove beneath the moonlit sky, amethyst, opal the secrets ply.
        Knight's great hall, strong and tall, with moonstone, quartz, its gates do fall.
        Golden sanctum's hidden trust, unveiled by sunstone, turquoise's thrust.

        Throne's domain, regal, vast, lapis, agate keys hold fast.
        Serpents' nest, coils tight, onyx, sunstone keys ignite.
        Silent tomb, whispers cease, obsidian, citrine keys release.

        In the gallery that whispers, sapphire key does rest,
        With emerald key beside, in the very same nest.
        Ruby key in enchanted hall does dwell,

        Wizards' study blocks the mirror's gleam,

        Mystic garden blocks the moonlit grove,
        Starlit tower blocks the crypt below.

        Golden sanctum, moonlit grove's trove.
