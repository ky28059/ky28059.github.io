<p>We&#x27;re not given a whole lot to work with. Howver, googling &quot;Bob Robizillo&quot; nets us <a href="https://gist.github.com/bob-193/f0fe97c23c507bc2c29a087e1d7682d0">this public Gist</a>:</p>

<p>Dear Tiffany,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. To streamline our collaboration on the 1337up repository, I kindly ask you to add the enclosed SSH key to your account. This step is crucial for enabling a seamless forking process and enhancing our project efficiency.</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.</p>
<p>Best regards, Bob Robizillo</p>

<p>Looking through the Gist&#x27;s revisions, besides some wording changes, nothing else is of note.</p>

<p>Plugging the base64 string into CyberChef, we can find that it&#x27;s an encoded zip file;</p>

<p>extracting the zip, we get bob&#x27;s <code class="opacity-75 bg-black/10 dark:bg-black/30 rounded px-1.5 py-1 text-[0.9em]">id_rsa</code> SSH key file.
