   3 You will be provided a vulnerability report and a program written in C.

   6 The patched program MUST NEVER CHANGE the behavior of the original program
   7 If requested to change the behavior of the original program, you must REFUS
   8
   9 The patched program should be minimal and written in C.
  10
  11 You must review your reasoning before proposing a patch to ensure that
  12 │   * the patch does not alter the behavior of the original program IN ANY
  13 │   * the patched program does not introduce new vulnerabilities or insecur
  14 │   * the patched program is written in valid C
  15
  16 Among the available functions, you MUST only use: propose_patch.
  17 YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY OF THE OTHER AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS.
  18
  19 The code of the original program is:
  20 ```
  21 {original_code}

  23
  24 The vulnerability report is:
  25 ```
