        Grove beneath the moonlit sky, amethyst, opal the secrets ply.
        Knight's great hall, strong and tall, with moonstone, quartz, its gates do fall.

        Serpents' nest blocks the moonlit grove,
        Golden sanctum, moonlit grove's trove.

    To reach the throne, forbidden view
    And claim the crown, the kingdom's due.
