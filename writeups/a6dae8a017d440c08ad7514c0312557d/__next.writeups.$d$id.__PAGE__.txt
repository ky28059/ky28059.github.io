        Atop a vault of shadows, silent, steep, topaz, pearl keys awake its sleep.
        Crypt sunken 'neath the time's decree, opal, garnet turn the key.

        Bow of Wizard's study, knowledge bound, diamond, topaz keys unwound.
        Grove beneath the moonlit sky, amethyst, opal the secrets ply.
        Knight's great hall, strong and tall, with moonstone, quartz, its gates do fall.
        Golden sanctum's hidden trust, unveiled by sunstone, turquoise's thrust.

        Each line a path, each path a fate.

        Wizards' study blocks the mirror's gleam,
        Moonlit grove blocks the enchanted hall's dream.
        Mystic garden blocks the moonlit grove,
        Starlit tower blocks the crypt below.

        Serpents' nest blocks the moonlit grove,
        Golden sanctum, moonlit grove's trove.

    ;goal
    And so the goal, clear and true,
    To reach the throne, forbidden view
    And claim the crown, the kingdom's due.
