        Atop a vault of shadows, silent, steep, topaz, pearl keys awake its sleep.
        Crypt sunken 'neath the time's decree, opal, garnet turn the key.

        Bow of Wizard's study, knowledge bound, diamond, topaz keys unwound.
        Grove beneath the moonlit sky, amethyst, opal the secrets ply.
        Knight's great hall, strong and tall, with moonstone, quartz, its gates do fall.
        Golden sanctum's hidden trust, unveiled by sunstone, turquoise's thrust.

        Wizards' study blocks the mirror's gleam,

        Starlit tower blocks the crypt below.

        Serpents' nest blocks the moonlit grove,
        Golden sanctum, moonlit grove's trove.

    ;goal
    And so the goal, clear and true,
    To reach the throne, forbidden view
    And claim the crown, the kingdom's due.
